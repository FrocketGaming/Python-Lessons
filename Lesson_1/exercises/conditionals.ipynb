    "- **Basic If/Else** - Simple decision making with two paths\n",
    "- **Elif Chains** - Multiple condition checking with elegant flow\n",
    "- **Multiple Conditions** - Complex logic with `and`, `or`, `not` operators\n",
    "- **Nested Conditionals** - Sophisticated decision trees and hierarchical logic\n",
    "- **Ternary Operator** - Concise conditional expressions for simple cases\n",
    "- **Truthiness** - Understanding how different values behave in boolean contexts\n",
    "- **Real-World Applications** - Banking, medical, gaming, and business logic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- Conditionals control the flow of your program based on data and logic\n",
    "- Use `elif` instead of multiple `if` statements for mutually exclusive conditions\n",
    "- Complex conditions can be built using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)\n",
    "- Nested conditionals create sophisticated decision trees\n",
    "- Ternary operators are great for simple conditional assignments\n",
    "- Understanding truthiness helps with validation and default value patterns\n",
    "- Good conditional logic makes programs intelligent and responsive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Practice creating your own decision-making systems\n",
    "2. Try building interactive programs with user choices\n",
    "3. Move on to loops and iteration lessons\n",
