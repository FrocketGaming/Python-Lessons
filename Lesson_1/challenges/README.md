# 🎯 Lesson 1 Challenges

## About These Challenges

These challenges are designed for **active learning** - you'll build complete programs from scratch using only Lesson 1 concepts. No starter code is provided; you must think through the implementation yourself.

## Challenge Structure

Each challenge includes:
- **Description**: What you're building
- **Requirements**: What your program must do
- **Constraints**: What concepts you can/cannot use
- **Example Output**: What success looks like
- **Success Criteria**: How to know you're done
- **Extension Ideas**: Ways to expand the project

## Available Challenges

1. **🔐 Password Generator** - Create secure passwords with strength analysis
2. **📏 Unit Converter** - Convert between measurement systems
3. **🧠 Quiz Game** - Interactive knowledge testing with scoring
4. **💪 Fitness Tracker** - Health metrics and goal tracking
5. **⏰ Countdown Timer** - Time calculations and event countdowns
6. **🌤️ Weather Report** - Weather data processing and forecasting
7. **🔒 Simple Cipher** - Text encoding and decoding system
8. **🍳 Recipe Scaler** - Ingredient scaling and cooking calculations

## Learning Philosophy

**You learn by doing, not by reading complete solutions.**

These challenges force you to:
- Think through problems step by step
- Apply concepts in practical contexts
- Debug and iterate on your own code
- Build confidence through accomplishment

## Getting Started

1. Pick a challenge that interests you
2. Read the requirements carefully
3. Plan your approach before coding
4. Build incrementally and test often
5. Don't be afraid to experiment!

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple** - get basic functionality working first
- **Use descriptive variable names** - make your code readable
- **Test frequently** - check your work as you build
- **Break down problems** - tackle one requirement at a time
- **Refer back to lessons** - review concepts as needed

Remember: There's no single "correct" solution. Focus on meeting the requirements using Lesson 1 concepts!
