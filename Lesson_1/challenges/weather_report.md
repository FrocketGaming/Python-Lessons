# 🌤️ Weather Report Generator Challenge

## Description
Build a weather report system that processes weather data, performs weather-related calculations, and generates formatted forecasts with analysis.

## Requirements
Your weather report generator must:
1. Process weather data for multiple days/locations
2. Convert between temperature units (F/C/K)
3. Calculate weather statistics (averages, ranges, trends)
4. Determine weather categories (hot/cold/mild, etc.)
5. Generate weather warnings based on conditions
6. Create organized forecast displays

## Constraints
- Only use: variables, strings, integers, floats, booleans, basic arithmetic
- No loops, functions, imports, or advanced data types
- Use sample weather data (hardcoded values)

## Example Output
