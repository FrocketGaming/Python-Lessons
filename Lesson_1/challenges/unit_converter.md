# 📏 Unit Converter Challenge

## Description
Build a comprehensive unit conversion program that converts between different measurement systems using mathematical formulas and variables.

## Requirements
Your unit converter must:
1. Convert between at least 3 measurement categories (distance, weight, temperature)
2. Handle multiple units within each category (e.g., inches/feet/miles for distance)
3. Display conversion formulas used
4. Show both original and converted values
5. Create organized comparison tables

## Constraints
- Only use: variables, strings, integers, floats, booleans, basic arithmetic
- No loops, functions, imports, or advanced data types
- Use precise conversion factors

## Example Output
```
📏 UNIT CONVERTER 📏

DISTANCE CONVERSIONS:
5.8 feet = 69.6 inches = 1.77 meters

WEIGHT CONVERSIONS: 
150 pounds = 68.04 kg = 2400 ounces

TEMPERATURE CONVERSIONS:
75°F = 23.9°C = 297.0 K

Formula used: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Converts between multiple unit types
- ✅ Shows accurate mathematical calculations
- ✅ Displays conversion formulas
- ✅ Uses descriptive variable names

## Extension Ideas
- Add time, speed, or volume conversions
- Create unit conversion tables
- Calculate cooking measurement conversions
