# üç≥ Recipe Scaler Challenge

## Description
Build a recipe scaling system that adjusts ingredient quantities for different serving sizes, converts between measurement units, and provides cooking guidance.

## Requirements
Your recipe scaler must:
1. Scale a recipe from original servings to new serving size
2. Handle different measurement units (cups, tablespoons, ounces, etc.)
3. Convert between measurement systems (metric/imperial)
4. Calculate cooking time adjustments
5. Provide ingredient substitution calculations
6. Display scaled recipe in organized format

## Constraints
- Only use: variables, strings, integers, floats, booleans, basic arithmetic
- No loops, functions, imports, or advanced data types
- Use standard cooking conversion factors

## Example Output
```
üç≥ RECIPE SCALER üç≥

ORIGINAL RECIPE (Serves 4):
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup sugar  
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup butter
Baking time: 25 minutes

SCALED RECIPE (Serves 6):
- 3 cups flour
- 1.5 cups sugar
- 4.5 eggs (use 4-5 eggs)
- 0.75 cups butter (3/4 cup)
Estimated baking time: 28 minutes

METRIC CONVERSIONS:
- 3 cups flour = 375g
- 1.5 cups sugar = 300g
- 3/4 cup butter = 170g

SHOPPING TIPS:
Buy 4 pounds flour (enough for 3 batches)
Current recipe costs approximately $8.50

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Scales ingredients proportionally
- ‚úÖ Converts between measurement units
- ‚úÖ Adjusts cooking times appropriately
- ‚úÖ Provides practical cooking advice

## Extension Ideas
- Add nutritional information scaling
- Include cost calculations per serving
- Create substitution ratios (butter to oil, etc.)
