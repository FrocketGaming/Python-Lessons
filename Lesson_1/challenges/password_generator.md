# 🔐 Password Generator Challenge

## Description
Build a program that creates secure passwords using only Lesson 1 concepts (variables, strings, arithmetic, booleans).

## Requirements
Your password generator must:
1. Generate 3 different passwords (8-16 characters each)
2. Use multiple character types: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters
3. Analyze each password (count character types)
4. Rate password strength (weak/medium/strong)
5. Display organized results

## Constraints
- Only use: variables, strings, integers, floats, booleans, basic arithmetic
- No loops, functions, imports, or advanced data types
- Use simple math patterns instead of random generation

## Example Output
```
🔐 PASSWORD GENERATOR 🔐

Password 1: aB3!mK9@pL2# (Strength: STRONG)
Password 2: X7$nC1&eH4%q (Strength: STRONG)  
Password 3: k9P@mT5!bN8$ (Strength: MEDIUM)

Analysis: 2 strong, 1 medium password generated
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Generates 3 unique passwords
- ✅ Counts character types correctly  
- ✅ Rates strength appropriately
- ✅ Uses only Lesson 1 concepts

## Extension Ideas
- Generate passwords of varying lengths
- Calculate estimated crack time
- Add different strength requirements
